## How it works

1. The user opens the MovieLib website and is presented with a landing page that displays the website logo, a search bar, three categories of movies: upcoming, popular, and top-rated, and 18 genres. Also, all movies that are currently playing in cinemas.

2. The user selects one of the categories or genres to browse and is taken to a page that displays a grid of movie posters for that category.

3. The user can click on any movie poster to view more details about the movie, including its synopsis, release date, and more.

4. If the user wants to save a movie to their watchlist, they need to create an account or sign in to their existing account.

5. Once the user is signed in, they can click a "Watchlist" button on any movie detail page to add the movie to their personal watchlist.

6. The user can access their watchlist by clicking on a "Watchlist" link in the dashboard. The watchlist displays all of the movies that the user has saved, including the movie poster, title, and overview.

7. If the user wants to remove a movie from their watchlist, they can click a "Remove" button next to the movie on their watchlist page.

8. The user can also update their account details, including their email and password, by clicking on an "Account" link in the website header (next feature).

Finally, the user can log out of their account by clicking on a "Logout" link from the dashboard.
